# About

This is the repo for [phteven.space](https://phteven.space), my blog.

The blog theme was made by [LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/) and detailed instructions are available at the
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog).

# Setup

```bash
nvm use 18
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run develop
```

# Deployment

No manual steps should be needed for deployment, they're all handled by GitHub actions
in `.github/workflows/prod_deploy.yml`.
