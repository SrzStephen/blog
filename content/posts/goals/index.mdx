import YoutubeEmbed from "../../components/Youtube/Youtube.tsx";

The inspiration for this blog is the talk by Troy Hunt that I find myself going back to
a few times every year as a lot of what he says really resonates with me.

<YoutubeEmbed

    title="Hack Your Career"
/>

I find that it's extremely useful to list goals when trying to do something new since
at some point you're going to have to make decisions, and a set of guiding goals
generally helps with that.

1. Understand the technology I write about well enough to explain it to others.
2. Practice writing coherent technical documentation.
3. Have examples of the things that I do to back up what I say.
4. Be able to point myself and others to things I write here when asked for explanations.


I've done a few things to help me not get super distracted when trying to achieve these goals:
* I haven't started from scratch, I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and
[LekoArts Template](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog)
as a starting point to help focus on content.
* I chose a template which allows me to write the blog in markdown. It also allows me to write arbitrary [React Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
and embed them for more dynamic content. The YouTube video in this page is actually one such component and was defined wth
```jsx
import YoutubeEmbed from "../../components/Youtube/Youtube.tsx";
<YoutubeEmbed
    embed_id="PBR5shDXVUI"
    title="Hack Your Career"
/>
```
* I have set up a set of GitHub actions to auto build and deploy this blog onto Github pages. It's free and takes no
additional effort on my part to maintain.
* I've set up some Google Analytics from the beginning to help me track whether anyone views the content.
